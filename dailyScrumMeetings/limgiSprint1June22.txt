Work Done:
- Made jshell run appropriate command if given
- Added template specific command java files to be used later (since all need to inherit methods, decided to pre-create them to save time later)
- Wrote sprint 2 backlog
- Started some of sprint2 tasks to reduce amount of work for next week (had time to do it)
- Overtook role as scrum master, to create a form of structure and orginization in this group that was lacking
	Progress was too slow, and time was wasted because lack of above.

Work To Do:
- code run method of cd and mkdir
- jshell requires current dir reference to be given to the filesystem class (ultimateley)

Problems:
Cant get rest of my sprint done since my tasks relies on FileSystem code (assigned to Pravinthan)
	June 22: Pravinthan cant work on FileSystem until 11pm since he has work
