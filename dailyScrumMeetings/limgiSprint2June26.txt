Work Done:
- Finished the tasks from spbl1
- implmented stack for popd and pushd
- wrote pseudo code for popd and pushd to be coded later

Work To Do:
- Code the run methods of popd and pushd
- Create exception class for when trying to pop from empty stack
- Check for typos, format and organize code that i wrote


Problems:
A group member is not following scrum process (not checking the sprint backlog to see what they need to do, rather asking me what they should do)
Another group member decided to create classes with different responisbilities than the ones outlined in the crcCards (without any notice) while I made classes under the assumption those responsibilities are present, resulting in conflict and wasting time
