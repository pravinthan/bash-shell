What did I do last time?
	- worked on tasks f.1-f.5
	- brainstormed ideas with team on how to use the execute method for commands

What do I plan to do now?
	- finish rest of task f
	- work on new tasks for the next sprint

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need Command class to be finished so I can use the inherited methods in Ls class
