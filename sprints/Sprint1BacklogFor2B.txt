Sprint 1 Backlog
July 10 to July 16


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

1) As a user, I want to be able to redirect the output of any command to a given file								... Add additionaly functionality to all execution of commands

2) As a user, I want to be able to recursively list all subdirectories of a given directory using command ls					... Add recursiveness to ls commmand

3) As a user, I want to be able to move either a directory or a file from a given location to another location					... Create move command

4) As a user, I want to be able to copy either a directory or a file from a given location to another location					... Create copy command

5) As a user, I want to be able to execute a previously executed command using its number relative to how many commands have been executed	... Create repeatCmd command





Specific Tasks to be Accomplished:

1)
a. Add implementation in command class so any sub class that needs to redirect can do so
b. Code in the case where user wants to redirect


2) 
a. Update Syntax check method
b. Add recursiveness to the command execution so that if key word -r is entered recursicely list all subdirectories in the given paths


3)
a. Create move command class and code the syntax check
b. Use copy command to move the given directory/file to a new directory but delete the original



4)
a. Create copy command class and code the syntax check
b. Code the run method to copy a directory or a file given directory (if copying directory, copy all its contents as well)

5)
a. Create repeatCmd class and code the syntax check
b. Create exception class for when trying to run repeatCmd with a # that is not in the history of cmds
c. Code the basic function of run method (not trying to redirect to a file)

A1) Update crcCards for new specification
A2) Change jshell so that it uses a hashtable
