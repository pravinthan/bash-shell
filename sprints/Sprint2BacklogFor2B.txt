Sprint 2 Backlog
July 17 to July 23


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

1) As a user, I want to be able to get a file at a given URL and add it to my current directory					... curl

2) As a user, I want to be able to give a string and a file and view all lines containing the string in that file			... grep

3) As a user, I want to be able to give a string and a directory and view all lines containing the string in all files of the directory	... grep




Specific Tasks to be Accomplished:

1) 
a. Create curl class and implement methods that need to be overridden
b. Make curl class create new file in current working directory with contents retrieved from url
c. Create URLHandler(?) class/interface for getting contents of a file in a url

2)
a. Create grep class and implement methods that need to be overridden except run
b. implement run such that it returns the lines that the regex matches in the single file path

3)
a. Add to implementation in 2b st this can be done recursively, given a directory to all the files that reside within that directory
