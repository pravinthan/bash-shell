# bash-shell

Developed a Java-based bash shell with a large feature set in a team of 4.

Managed source code and tracked changes while using the Scrum framework for agile, feedback-oriented development.

Implemented the shell with object-oriented design while using design patterns such as singleton design pattern and dependency injection design pattern to prevent issues in the code.

Tested and debugged the program using unit testing through JUnit 5, resulting in a stable environment to develop in.
